## The Problem

The fashion industry is one of the world's largest polluters. In the Philippines, fast fashion drives overconsumption while perfectly wearable clothes pile up in landfills. Thrift and swap culture exists — but there's no trusted, gamified, digital space dedicated to it.

**SDG 12 — Responsible Consumption and Production**

Suot creates a circular fashion economy, giving clothes a second life through community-based swapping instead of buying new.

| Pain Point | How Suot Solves It |
|---|---|
| Clothes discarded due to trends | List and swap instead of throw away |
| No dedicated swap platform in PH | Purpose-built for Filipino swappers |
| Buying pre-loved feels risky | OTP verification + user ratings |
| Sustainability feels inaccessible | Gamified points make it fun |

---

- **Community Feed** — OOTDs, stories, and linked items with emoji reactions, hashtag filters, and a Friends/Discover panel

## How to Run / Install (For Developers)

### Prerequisites
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account and project
- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) API key *(for AI pricing)*
- VS Code with Live Server extension

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jamaica81828282/Suot_Web.git
cd Suot_Web
```

### 2. Configure Supabase
Open `src/db/supabase.js` and replace:
```js
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-project.supabase.co'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key-here'
```

### 3. Configure Gemini AI
Create `src/personal/config.js`:
```js
const CONFIG = {
  GEMINI_API_KEY: 'your-gemini-api-key-here'
}
```
> `config.js` is in `.gitignore` — your key will never be pushed to GitHub.

### 4. Set up the database
Run the following SQL files in order in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. `docs/documents/supabase-schema.sql` — core tables
2. `docs/documents/home-feed-v2.sql` — post reactions, hashtags, linked items
3. `docs/documents/wallet-circulation.sql` — circulation buffer, 30-day expiry trigger, wallet events log

Required tables: `profiles`, `items`, `swaps`, `messages`, `wishlist`, `follows`, `notifications`, `wallet_events`, `post_reactions`, `stories`

Required storage buckets *(set to Public)*: `item-images`, `post-images`

### 5. Run
Right-click `src/auth/login.html` → **Open with Live Server**

> **Note on video calls:** WebRTC requires HTTPS in production. On localhost with Live Server, calls work between two tabs on the same machine. For calls between different devices on the same network, use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or deploy to a host with HTTPS.

## Wallet Circulation Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Active wallet cap | 2,500 pts |
| Overflow | Any top-up exceeding 2,500 pts moves the excess to the Circulation Buffer automatically |
| Auto-refill | When active pts drop to ≤ 500 and the buffer has funds, active is topped back up to 2,500 |
| Buffer expiry | Circulation buffer balance expires **30 days** after it is received — use it or lose it |
| All movements logged | Every overflow, refill, spend, earn, and top-up is recorded in `wallet_events` |

---

## Video Call Architecture

Video calls use **native browser WebRTC** with **Supabase Realtime Broadcast** as the signaling channel — no third-party video service, no meeting codes, no accounts needed.


TURN relay servers (OpenRelay) are included as fallback for networks where direct P2P is blocked by NAT.
